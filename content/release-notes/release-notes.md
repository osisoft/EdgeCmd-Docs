# Release notes

EdgeCmd utility 1.3

## Overview

Edge Data Store (EDS) and AVEVA Adapters have a REST API that allows user interaction. Configuration is one of the most common interactions. This command line tool, EdgeCmd utility, uses this REST API to apply all changes and administration functions to EDS and AVEVA adapters. Specifically, EdgeCmd utility's command line interface uses configuration and administration functions of the REST API, so the user does not need to know the REST routes. EdgeCmd utility thus improves the user experience, facilitates easier scripting experiences and provides built-in help.

For more information, see [EdgeCmd utility](xref:index).
