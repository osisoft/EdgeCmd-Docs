# EdgeCmd utility

Use OSIsoft's proprietary tool, EdgeCmd utility, to configure and administer Edge Data Store on Linux and Windows using command line arguments. Because EdgeCmd is a command line tool, adjustments to the configuration can be made on the fly without programming. If you prefer, all tasks available in EdgeCmd can be performed using REST APIs. 

**Note:** Configuration and administrative REST interfaces are generally exposed through the command line. Read/write capabilities to the EDS storage component, OMF ingress, and SDS read/write capabilities are only available using the REST API.
