For example: edgecmd -port=5591 Configuration <RestOfTheCommand> Add components Complete the following procedure to add a new component: Open command line. Type the following in the command line, replacing <componentId> and <componentType> with the values that you want and press Enter. Note: The only valid component type is the adapter type. For example, if you are trying to register a new Modbus component, use Modbus and if you are trying to register an OPC UA component, use OpcUa . Refer to the specific adapter's user guide for the adapter's component type. edgecmd Configuration System Components componentId=<componentId> componentType=<componentType> Example : Modbus adapter component registration edgecmd Configuration System Components componentId=Modbus1 componentType=Modbus Configure components The adapters have the following configurable facets: data source, data selection, and logging.

For example: edgecmd -port=5591 Configuration <RestOfTheCommand> Change all values of a facet Complete the following procedure to change all values of a facet: Open command line. Type the componentId and facetName , followed by the key=value pairs that you want to change. Then press Enter. Example: Change all values in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration OmfEgress Logging LogLevel=Warning LogFileSizeLimitBytes=32768 LogFileCountLimit=5 Configure key=value pairs in a facet Complete the following procedure to configure any number of valid key=value pairs in a facet: Open command line. Type the componentId and facetName followed by the key=value pairs that you want to change, and press Enter. Example: Change a single value in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration OmfEgress Logging LogFileCountLimit=5 Add an entry to a collection configuration Complete the following procedure to add an entry to a collection configuration: Open command line. Type the componentId and facetName followed by the key=value pairs, and press Enter. Example: Add the 'Health Endpoints' facet to the 'System' component: edgecmd Configuration System HealthEndpoints Id=endpoint_1 Endpoint=endpointURL UserName=UserName Password=Password Note: If an entry with the specified ID already exists, it will be updated based on the new key=value pairs. Configure with JSON Files You can also configure the adapter by importing a JSON file into the EdgeCmd application. A file import completely replaces the existing configurations; therefore, you cannot use it to change individual values in a facet without modifying others. Import bulk configuration Complete the following procedure to import a bulk configuration: Open command line. Type the following in the command line, replacing <PathToJsonFile> with the path to the file, and press Enter. edgecmd Configuration file=<PathToJsonFile> Import facet specific configuration Complete the following procedure to import a facet specific configuration file for a component: Open command line. Type the following in the command line, replacing <componentId> with the ID of the component, <facetName> with the name of the facet, and <PathToJsonFile> with the path to the file. Then press Enter. edgecmd Configuration <componentId> <facetName> file=<PathToJsonFile> Import facets configuration in bulk Complete the following procedure to import a file with configuration for individual facets as a bulk file import operation: Note: The file must contain only information for the given component ID. Open command line. Type the file name as shown in the Logging.json example and press Enter. edgecmd Configuration file=\"~/Logging.json\" Example: { \"OmfEgress\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Warning\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 19283, \"logFileCountLimit\": 999 } } } Note: The command only affects the specified key=value pairs for the 'Logging' facet in the 'OmfEgress' component, it does not change any other components or facets. However, import affects all key=value pairs in the facet. If you import the following example JSON file, the 'logLevel' and 'logFileSizeLimitBytes' values will be modified and the remaining values in the 'Logging' facet will be reset to their default values (logFileCountLimit). { \"OmfEgress\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Warning\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 19283 } } }"

Note: Configuration and administrative REST interfaces are generally exposed through the command line. Install EdgeCmd utility The following sections provide instructions to install the EdgeCmd utility on Windows or Linux. Install EdgeCmd utility on Windows Note: You must have administrative privileges to run the installer. Complete the following procedure to install the EdgeCmd utility on Windows: Copy the EdgeCmd.msi file to the file system of the device. To start the installer, double-click the EdgeCmd.msi file in Windows Explorer. Note: To change the install path from the default path of C:\\Program Files\\OSIsoft\\EdgeCmd , enter the following command in the command prompt and update the <file_path>. OSIsoft recommends you use the default value. msiexec /i EdgeCmd.msi INSTALLFOLDER=<file_path> Note: INSTALLFOLDER must be typed in all caps as shown in the preceding example. The EdgeCmd utility is installed on your device. Install EdgeCmd utility on Linux Note: You must have administrative privileges to install the software, for example the root or sudo privilege. Complete the following procedure to install the EdgeCmd utility on Linux: Open a terminal window and type the sudo command for the appropriate EdgeCmd .deb file for your processor: Debian 9 or later (Intel/AMD 64-bit processors) sudo apt install ./EdgeCmd_linux-x64.deb Debian 9 or later (ARM32, Raspberry PI 2,3,4: Raspbian, BeagleBone) sudo apt install ./EdgeCmd_linux-arm.deb Debian 9 or later (Raspberry PI 3,4: Ubuntu ARM64 Server, Google Coral Dev Board, Nvidia Nano Jetson) sudo apt install ./EdgeCmd_linux-arm64.deb A validation check for prerequisites will be completed. After the check for prerequisites succeeds, you are prompted with the option to change the default port, which is 5590 . If the Linux OS is up to date, the install will succeed and the EdgeCmd utility will be running on your device. If the install fails, run the following commands from the terminal window and try the install again: sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Access EdgeCmd utility The EdgeCmd utility locations used in the following procedures are based on the installation instructions in this topic. See Install EdgeCmd utility . Access EdgeCmd utility on Windows Complete the following procedure to access EdgeCmd utility on Windows: Open a command prompt. Change to the following directory: C:\\Program Files\\OSIsoft\\EdgeCmd Type edgecmd.exe and press Enter. Note: Specify the full path when you use EdgeCmd utility on Windows. Access EdgeCmd utility on Linux Complete the following procedure to access EdgeCmd utility on Linux: Open a terminal window. Type the following path in the terminal and press Enter: /opt/OSIsoft/EdgeCmd/edgecmd Note: You can access EdgeCmd utility without using the full path on Linux."
