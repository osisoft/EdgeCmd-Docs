It does not change any other components or facets; however, import affects all key-value pairs in the facet. If you import the following example JSON file, the 'StreamStorageLimitMb' and 'StreamStorageTargetMb' values will be modified and the remaining values in the 'Runtime' facet will be reset to their default values (IngressDebugExpiration, CheckpointRateInSec, TransactionLogLimitMB, and EnableTransactionLog). { \"Storage\": { \"Runtime\": { \"StreamStorageLimitMb\": 66, \"StreamStorageTargetMb\": 33, } } }"

Type the following in the command line, replacing <componentId> with the ID of the component, <facetName> with the name of the facet, and <PathToJsonFile> with the path to the file. Then press Enter. edgecmd Configuration <componentId> <facetName> file=<PathToJsonFile> Import facets configuration in bulk Complete the following steps to import a file with configuration for individual facets, but not individual values of a facet, as a bulk file import operation: Note: The file must contain only information for the given component ID. Access EdgeCmd utility through the command line. Type the file name as shown in the Logging.json example and press Enter. edgecmd Configuration file=\"~/Logging.json\" Example: { \"Modbus1\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Warning\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 19283, \"logFileCountLimit\": 999 } } } Note: The command only affects the specified key=value pairs for the 'Logging' facet in the 'Modbus1' component, it does not change any other components or facets. However, import affects all key=value pairs in the facet. If you import the following example JSON file, the 'logLevel' and 'logFileSizeLimitBytes' values are modified and the remaining values in the 'Logging' facet are reset to their default values (logFileCountLimit). { \"Modbus1\": { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Warning\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 19283 } } }"

For more information, see Configure an adapter with JSON files . Note: The examples in this topic are using the default port number 5590 . If you specified a different port number for your adapter, you need to add it in the command.

Example: TestUser\\OilCompany becomes TestUser\\\\OilCompany In Linux , add three slashes. Example: TestUser\\OilCompany becomes TestUser\\\\\\\\OilCompany Change all values of a facet Complete the following steps to change all values of a facet: Access EdgeCmd utility through the command line. Type edgecmd Configuration and then the componentId and facetName , followed by the key=value pairs. Then press Enter. Example: Change all values in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration Modbus1 Logging LogLevel=Warning LogFileSizeLimitBytes=32768 LogFileCountLimit=5 Configure key=value pairs in a facet Complete the following steps to configure any number of valid key=value pairs in a facet: Access EdgeCmd utility through the command line. Type edgecmd Configuration and then the componentId and facetName followed by the key=value pairs to change, and press Enter. Example: Change a single value in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration Modbus1 Logging LogFileCountLimit=5 Add an entry to a collection configuration Complete the following steps to add an entry to a collection configuration: Access EdgeCmd utility through the command line. Type edgecmd Configuration and then the componentId and facetName followed by the key=value pairs, and press Enter. Example: Add the 'Health Endpoints' facet to the 'System' component: edgecmd Configuration Modbus1 HealthEndpoints Id=endpoint_1 Endpoint=endpointURL UserName=UserName Password=Password Note: If an entry with the specified ID already exists, it is updated based on the new key=value pairs."

Install EdgeCmd utility on Windows Note: You must have administrative privileges to run the installer. Complete the following steps to install the EdgeCmd utility on Windows: Copy the EdgeCmd.msi file to the file system of the device. To start the installer, double-click the EdgeCmd.msi file in Windows Explorer. Note: To change the install path from the default path of C:\\Program Files\\OSIsoft\\EdgeCmd , enter the following command in the command prompt and update the <file_path>. OSIsoft recommends you use the default value. msiexec /i EdgeCmd.msi INSTALLFOLDER=<file_path> Note: You must type INSTALLFOLDER in all caps. The EdgeCmd utility is installed on your device. Install EdgeCmd utility on Linux Note: You must have administrative privileges to install the software, for example, root or sudo privilege. Complete the following steps to install the EdgeCmd utility on Linux: Open a terminal window and type the sudo command for the appropriate EdgeCmd .deb file for your processor: Debian 9 or later (Intel/AMD 64-bit processors) sudo apt install ./EdgeCmd_linux-x64.deb Debian 9 or later (ARM32, Raspberry PI 2,3,4: Raspbian, BeagleBone) sudo apt install ./EdgeCmd_linux-arm.deb Debian 9 or later (Raspberry PI 3,4: Ubuntu ARM64 Server, Google Coral Dev Board, Nvidia Nano Jetson) sudo apt install ./EdgeCmd_linux-arm64.deb A validation check for prerequisites is completed. After the check for prerequisites succeeds, you are prompted with the option to change the default port of the adapter, which is 5590 . If the Linux OS is up to date, the install will succeed and the EdgeCmd utility is running on your device.
